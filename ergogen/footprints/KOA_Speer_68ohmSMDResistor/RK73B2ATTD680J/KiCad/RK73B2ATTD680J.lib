F4 " Small size and light weight.   Excellent heat resistance and weather resistance are ensured by the use of metal glaze thick film.   High stability and high reliability with the triple-layer structure of electrode.   Applicable to various kinds of automatic mounters for taping, etc.   Suitable for both flow and reflow solderings.   Products with lead free termination meet EU-RoHS requirements. EU-RoHS regulation is not intended for Pb-glass contained in electrode, resistor element and glass." 550 -150 50 H I L CNN "Description"
